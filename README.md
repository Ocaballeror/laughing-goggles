A collection of simple shell scripts that I've written over the last few months and that I consider useful

I personally stored them in a folder that I added to the path, removed the extension and made them executable. This way I can easily run the scripts from anywhere I want, and edit/view them without root permissions. The added script dubbed "install.sh" will do all those things for you.

I store here the scripts that are too big for my [bash configuration file](https://github.com/ocaballeror/dotfiles), or that I don't use very regularly
